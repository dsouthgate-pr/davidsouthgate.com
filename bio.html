          Southgate began his career as an independent 
          writer and publicist in the early '90s and quickly earned a reputation

          and several local and nationally prominent artists and arts organizations.<br>
          <br>
          "In the early and mid '90s, I worked with some of this decade's most 
          progressive artists and cultural thinkers, including people like Arthur 
          Dong, Kate Bornstein, David Byrne, Bill T. Jones, Holly Hughes, Tim 
          Miller, Meredith Monk, and others," says Southgate. </font></p>

          artistically and intellectually challenging artists showed me how to 
          think outside of conventional lines." During this freelance period, 
          Southgate was also the senior staff writer at <i>Equal Time</i>, a bi-monthly, 
          award-winning special interest publication. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">He 
          also penned articles for Minneapolis-based <i>Skyway News</i>, <i>City 
          Pages</i>, and <i>Twin Cities Reader</i>. "I've authored articles that 
          were picked up by the AP wire and some that were translated into three 
          Asian languages," says Southgate. A newspaper expose series he wrote 
          helped to bring about a change in leadership at a governmental department

          Arts</a>, where in 1996 he worked with designer to launch the arts organization's 
          first Web site.</font></p>

          Magazine</a>, he developed extensive editorial plans, wrote and edited 
          Web articles, and managed the production of the sites. Following a merger 
          with KeyTech LLC, Southgate became the company's Executive Producer. 
          He continued to develop editorial line-ups, content, and account winning 
          sales proposals. In another merger, Southgate joined AisleFive. There 
          he functioned as an Executive Producer and Writer for an emerging e-commerce 
          venture. All three ventures were owned by Key Investment, co-founded 
          by West Publishing magnet Vance Opperman.</font></p>

          March 1999, Southgate joined techies.com, an agressive Web-based staffing 
          company that accelerated into 39 markets in a matter of months. There, 
          Southgate led a staff of editors, writers, and a community builder to 
          develop content for 39 national market sites, bulding online readership 
          of editorial content to 250,000 page views. Southgate was handpicked

          acquisition efforts for the online content group. </font></p>

          was active in Minneapolis-based community, artistic, and journalistic 
          organizations in the mid and late '90s. He chaired the internationally

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
          Web demands a more interactive style of writing – tighter, less like 
          market-ese, more scannable," says Southgate. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">"Sound 
          editorial principles can't be replaced by fads and guesswork. In the 
          age of real-time marketing, targeted, brand appropriate content and 
          campaigns can be delivered to the right consumer at the right time. 
          It's the ultimate placement strategy. With Web-based measurement tools, 
          you can know up to the minute if your content is effective, making adjustments 
          accordingly."</font></p>
