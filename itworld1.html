        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There's 
          a general sense of unrest brewing in the minds of the caffeine-buzzed 
          technology workers around Seattle. Some are unhappy about unequal benefits, 
          long hours, and an uneven work-life balance, despite the massive profits 
          of their employers. They're mad enough to strike and organize collective 
          bargaining units. Their strikes come at a time of unprecedented and 
          dynamic economic growth. Unemployment is low and labor unions are generally 
          out of favor, especially among independent-minded technology workers.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
          Techies take home the economic prizes. They have access to potentially 
          lucrative stock options, they command high salaries, and they enjoy 
          casual work environments, flexible work hours, membership at the company 
          gym, and subsidized meals at the company gourmet cafeteria. Who needs 
          a union, right?</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
          Apparently several thousand tech workers around Seattle do. On February 
          15, 17,000 engineers and technical workers at Boeing walked off the 
          job to express their displeasure with their employment contracts. Now 
          entering its fourth week, the surprising action by the 56-year-old Society 
          for Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) is one of 
          the largest white-collar strikes in the private sector in US history. 
          SPEEA represents 23,000 workers at Boeing. This is only the second strike 
          by SPEEA members; the first, which took place in 1993, lasted only a 
          day, and was basically ineffective. </font></p>

        </table>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
          issues this time run much deeper, says SPEEA general counsel Phyllis 
          Rogers. There's a growing feeling among Boeing's technical workers that 
          their company no longer values them. Take salaries, for example: Boeing 
          techies are paid well below the industry standard. The other highly 
          emotional issue is that Boeing is cutting benefit packages, including 
          health care and workforce training. Boeing's culture has changed since 
          the $13.3 billion merger with McDonnell Douglas that was announced in 
          December 1996.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
          The changes have hit long-term Boeing employees the hardest. Even some 
          nonunion Boeing employees have joined the picket line, Rogers says "They're 
          striking because they're angry and they feel disrespected," she says, 
          noting that this is not just a matter of money. "There are people in 
          the strike line who make $100,000 a year right next to those who make 
          $30,000." </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
          move against Boeing is the most obvious indication of union activity 
          in Seattle, but there are other signs as well. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Affiliated 
          with and supported by the Communications Workers of America (http://www.cwa-union.org/), 
          the Seattle-based Washington Alliance of Technical Workers (WashTech) 
          - "the voice of the digital workforce" - has been organizing techies 
          since October 1998. The group has been criticizing Microsoft over its 
          working conditions and temporary-worker benefits. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">WashTech 
          has 250 dues-paying members (up from 200 in August), and 1,600 people 
          subscribe to its email newsletter. The group, which hopes to add another 
          250 members by year's end, is busy watching Microsoft after the software 
          giant announced its "365-in 100-out" policy. The policy cuts off temp 
          assignments at 365 days, and bars those temps from further employment 
          at Microsoft until after a 100-day waiting period. All this labor activity 
          clearly indicates that there's another side to America's economic success 
          story. Not everyone is happy in the new economy. There definitely is 
          a place for union organization of tech workers, just as there may be 
          for medical doctors who began organizing last year over their dissatisfaction 
          with HMOs. WashTech organizers are fighting to secure the same employment 
          benefits for contract workers that regular Microsoft employees receive. 
          Why, WashTech asks, should contract workers, who toil on the same projects 
          as regular employees, not receive the same vacation pay and access to 
          stock options? Though Boeing and Microsoft are high profile examples, 
          don't expect labor organizing of high-tech workers to become widespread.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
          The brevity and transient nature of many tech assignments makes it tougher 
          for unions to organize workers. Though there are pockets of organizing 
          activity thanks to unions and lobbying groups, the workers themselves 
          aren't rushing to the side of their technology brethren. In general, 
          support for unions among tech workers is weak. A representative Usenet 
          posting about the Boeing strike tells workers to quit their whining. 
          "You guys want what the machinists have. All I hear from you guys is 
          complaining. Quit complaining. Sissies don't deserve what you currently 
          get," wrote one irate contributor. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Last 
          year a poll of techies.com members asked members if they supported the 
          notion of giving stock options to temp workers on long-term assignments. 
          Sixty percent of respondents said no. The attitude of many workers is: 
          If you don't like your job, you can leave it. Today's worker mobility 
          is unsurpassed. And for those who choose to leave the Boeing family, 
          there's always a start-up beckoning with stock options. </font></p>
