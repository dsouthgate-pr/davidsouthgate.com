          LAN (WLAN) in sales is the talk of your company. But your IS department 
          didn’t install it. Upon investigation, you learn that a well-intentioned 
          sales team leader simply plugged into the network with a $180 D-link 
          wireless access point. Surprised? You shouldn’t be. </font></p>

          are a growing problem for technology departments, according to Carl 
          Klunch, vice president of Gartner Research. Anyone with a little money 
          and a basic understanding of network cables can hook one up. </font></p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Security 
          risks and the increasing demand for PDAs and other wireless devices 
          make supporting wireless networks a critical issue for CIOs this year—one 
          that calls for CIOs to get in front of potential problems by creating 
          a strong wireless policy, experts advise. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
          this article, we’ll explain why today’s enterprises literally can’t 
          afford not to create a wireless policy that covers both corporate and 
          personal use needs. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><font size="2">Potential 
          security threats</font></b><br>
          </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">According 
          to "IT/IS Industry Forecast 2002: U.S. and Europe," a report from CyberAtlas 
          Research, a division of INT Media, 33 percent of U.S. Fortune 1000 companies 
          have already installed wireless communication systems. Another 25 percent 
          plan to deploy wireless systems in 2002, although these initiatives 
          will only account for 5.8 percent of technology budgets in 2002, according 
          to Gartner. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Along 
          with the potential breach issues of an unsecured WLAN, wireless devices 
          can also expose companies to a potential security nightmare. The devices 
          are easily stolen from employees in airports and restaurants, potentially 
          placing proprietary information in the hands of competitors. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Whether 
          it’s to head off pirate projects or to provide guidance for a new deployment 
          or enhancements to an existing system, a wireless policy is a necessity 
          and should dictate everything from the devices and platforms supported 
          to security measures, access privileges, and what constitutes appropriate 
          use.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
          “When it comes to policy making,” said Patricia Fusco, managing editor 
          of the CyberAtlas Research report, “the first decision CIOs must make 
          is which wireless platform their networks will support—802.11x, Bluetooth, 
          HomeRF, and the like. From there, the remaining major issues are security, 
          security, and security.” </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">At 
          present, there’s no clear leader among wireless platforms, according 
          to Larry Kinder, global CIO and executive vice president of Cendant 
          Corporation. Cendant’s 31 companies and 21 CIOs, who Kinder directs, 
          have deployed several wireless platforms. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“But 
          we haven’t figured out what’s the best application,” said Kinder, who 
          noted that Bluetooth looks promising because centralized management 
          of the devices is handled at the server level, and appropriate security 
          measures are somewhat dictated by the devices themselves. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Cendant’s 
          employees use wireless devices for everything from low-end Web-clipping 
          services on Palm VIIs and e-mail via BlackBerry devices to helping customers 
          checking in and out of Avis Rent-a-Car. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“With 
          limited deployments, we’ve piloted a lot of the technologies to see 
          if they would catch on,” explained Kinder. What works and doesn’t is 
          then shared between CIOs from the 31 subcorporations to identify best 
          practices. Those best practices then guide decisions for future technological 
          solutions. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><font size="2">One 
          policy doesn’t do it all<br>
          </font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
          addition to its corporate wireless policy, Cendant has also put personal-use 
          policies in place, something that all companies should do, said Nancy 
          Flynn, executive director at the ePolicy Institute. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">“Anytime 
          you allow your employees to access the e-mail, intranet, or Internet 
          system, you’re putting your organization at risk of a broad range of 
          potential and costly liabilities,” said Flynn. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Personal-use 
          policies can protect companies against many liability problems, including 
          those arising from the following:<br>
          </font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Discrimination 
          suits</font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Lost 
          productivity</font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Electronic 
          sabotage</font>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Wasted 
          resources </font> 
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">To 
            protect themselves against such losses, companies have to explain 
            the appropriate use of company hardware inside and outside the office. 
            The goal is to cover every possible contingency, said Flynn. She recommends 
            that companies include the following points in personal-use policies: 
            </font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Hardware, 
            wireless devices, and the password used to access them belong to the 
            company. </b>Companies, including Cendant, often purchase devices 
            in bulk to obtain better pricing and then issue the devices to employees. 
            Companies should explain that although the wireless devices may be 
            taken physically out of the office, the devices and the passwords 
            are both to remain company property at all times. Companies also need 
            to keep comprehensive lists of all employee passwords, advised Flynn, 
            so that in the event the employee resigns or is terminated, he or 
            she will not be able to keep using the device or lock the company 
            out of any systems. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Company 
            wireless devices should not be used for personal correspondence.</b> 
            In the event of a workplace lawsuit, the device and the correspondence 
            can be subpoenaed. Information contained within the devices could 
            include some personal information that would be potentially embarrassing 
            to the employee or the family. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>The 
            company has the right to monitor all electronic correspondence. </b>The 
            policy should spell out that the company has the right to monitor 
            all e-mail and Internet activity. This point helps control e-mail 
            content, noted Flynn, who also suggested that companies should specifically 
            spell out what kind of language is and is not acceptable in company 
            correspondence as well. </font></li>
          <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>Outline 
            the disciplinary action taken if the policy is broken.</b> If an employee 
            violates policy, one course of action is to revoke his or her computer 
            privileges, said Flynn, which would render an employee virtually useless 
            in the modern office. In addition to spelling out disciplinary action 
            in the wireless policy, Flynn recommends that companies conduct annual 
            formal training once a year that further explains what will happen 
            if the policy is violated. She also advises companies to issue frequent 
            reminders of the importance of complying with the policies.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Not 
          too late to act</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
          </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Even 
          if your enterprise already has a "pirate" rollout in place or you’ve 
          widely deployed wireless devices, it’s never too late to implement a 
          policy, according to the experts. And while such policies ultimately 
          can’t stop a sales team, or any other business unit, from deploying 
          unauthorized wireless stations, the policy will serve as a guide for 
          what’s appropriate and why, and it may stop further violations from 
          occurring. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As Jeremy 
          Grigg, Gartner’s research director for business management of IT, noted, 
          “Wireless is not going away, and it has to be considered very carefully. 
          If you don’t consider it [through policy making], the decisions will 
          be made for you.” </font></p>
