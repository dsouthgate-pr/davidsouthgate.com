        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The IT 
          industry has long been viewed a male-dominated domain, providing few 
          career opportunities for female techies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As TechRepublic 
          columnist Bob Weinstein pointed out in a recent column, "Career outlook 
          rosier, but obstacles persist for women in IT," there are many hurdles 
          preventing women from reaching upper management. The tech industry has 
          a history of pay inequity between men and women, and because many women 
          techies grapple with both home and family needs, the long hours required 
          of a tech job often prevent them from reaching their long-term career 
          goals. </font> </p>

        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
          low pay and the work-vs.-home life issue may not be the only factors 
          at play. In a member discussion, TechRepublic member jennyred said the 
          lack of females in IT is the result of "a combination of persistent 
          sexism in the field and the fact that women feel that they would do 
          better in more 'soft-skills'-oriented jobs—whether that's true or not 
          is up for debate.” </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
          if lower pay is a major factor, there’s good news for all those female 
          techies that have hung in, worked the hours, and balanced all of their 
          responsibilities. </font></p>

          If you’re a woman with 20 years of tech experience—or if you’ve got 
          experienced female managers spearheading IT units—it might be time for 
          a raise. According to 2000 income data reported in the "IEEE-USA Salary 
          & Fringe Benefit Survey, 2001 Edition," the median income of professional 
          women with 20 to 29 years in the electrotechnology and IT fields is 
          7 percent higher than that of like-experienced men. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Women 
          with 20 to 24 years experience earned $100,037 per year from primary 
          sources, while men made $98,500. Women with 25 to 29 years received 
          $107,000; men, $99,600. Primary sources include base salary, bonuses, 
          commissions, and self-employment income. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          survey data represent the responses of nearly 10,000 IEEE-USA members. 
          (The IEEE has 365,000 members worldwide.) But although the report's 
          findings seem to provide evidence that women are moving ahead in the 
          IT field, some believe that the battle is not over yet. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Salary 
          survey has its skeptics</font></b> <br>
          This latest salary news, released in late December 2001 by the IEEE-USA, 
          an arm of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, isn’t 
          being endorsed across the board. Several compensation experts are skeptical 
          of the survey results, noting that few women reach the highest rungs 
          on the corporate technology ladder. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          trying to find an explanation for the “somewhat surprising” IEEE survey 
          results, Bill Coleman, Salary.com's senior vice president of compensation, 
          said, “It is possible that the small population of women who have been 
          working in the field for 20-plus years represents the ‘cream of the 
          crop,’ whereas the men include a more normal distribution of strong, 
          average, and weak performers. This would be a likely scenario if these 
          salary findings are consistent with IEEE membership surveys in past 
          years.” </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
          oddity about the IEEE findings, added Coleman, is that in other surveys—IT 
          specific or otherwise—the pay gap between men and women widens as age 
          and experience increase, with men continuing to make more money. A techies.com 
          survey of more than 100,000 technology professionals in 2001 reported 
          that there was “virtual pay parity” among people with less than five 
          years of experience. That survey reported that of employees with 10 
          or more years of experience, women earned, on average, 9 percent less 
          than men. (Ten Speed Press, 2000, $12.95). “Twenty years ago, the figure 
          I used to quote was that women made 59 cents on the dollar [men earned],” 
          said Chapman. In the early 90s, that figure rose to 79 cents, he added. 
          </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Achieving 
          earnings equality has historically been akin to breaking the four-minute 
          mile, explained Chapman—except perhaps in the tech industry, where there 
          appears to be a very small gender-related pay gap, noted Coleman. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Carolyn 
          Leighton, chairwoman and founder of Women in Technology International 
          (WITI), is also critical of the survey. </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">“I 
          find it difficult to believe that the information collected in this 
          study represents an accurate picture of access to equity pay for women,” 
          she said. "Based on extensive discussions with executive women and surveys 
          conducted by WITI in the past, I find these conclusions to be highly 
          questionable at best,” Leighton added.</font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Very 
          few women work at the top of major U.S. corporations, something the 
          survey seemingly ignores, said Leighton. The Fortune 500 includes only 
          five woman CEOs, she noted. (Women make up 6.8 percent of the IEEE’s 
          U.S. membership.) </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          survey reported that in the lower ranks of IT staff, men continue to 
          earn more than their female counterparts. Of those with five to six 
          years of experience, men made a median income of $76,000, compared to 
          $68,000 for women. Men received $96,000 at 15 to 19 years, while women 
          earned $84,700. (The median primary income for U.S. IEEE members in 
          2000 was $93,100.) </font></p>
        <p align="LEFT"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          full IEEE survey was released in June of 2001, and results were announced 
          in late December of 2001. </font></p>
